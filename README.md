# Hi, I’m InfinityLoop (he/him/his).

## I am an indie game developer usually coding at school when I'm not supposed to.

I make games and host them on my website (https://infinityloop1.netlify.app) and my itch.io (https://infinityloopgames.itch.io).

I also sometimes make extensions for TurboWarp.

I also collaborate with @dacoder123456m to help with his sites.
